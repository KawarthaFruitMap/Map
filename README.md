Kawartha Fruit Tree Map 

This map is a project created by Fleming College GIS Students (2021) Korey Hayes, Riley Sweeney and Navjot Kaur Sodhi. The project was created for the Kawartha Lakes and Haliburton Communities.

Using Leaflet JS Library (https://leafletjs.com/), and KoboToolbox (https://www.kobotoolbox.org/) we created an open-source and completely free mapping application. 
This application allows public users to add edible plant locations located on PUBLIC property to a kobotoolbox form. These locations are actively uploaded to the leaflet map featuring many plugin widgets. 

The benefits of this program will include:

Food

-provide access to healthy food for all including children, senior and adults who live with hunger and in food poverty in our communities, each tree providing as much as 15 bushes per year

-provide an opportunity to the public to be reconnected to food trees,become more aware, supportive and engaged in local urban ecology and local food.

-increase public awareness on local poverty and provide an opportunity to become engaged in effective community action throughacts of kindness for themselves and others, come together and have a direct effect on the health of our community.

Supporting Wildlife

-decrease food waste

-access local food supply supplanting a portion of our emission intense global food supply.

-act as an important addition to the CKL Bee City pollination map and help identify gaps in the current pollinator pathway informing future forestry planning

Building Community

-connect people to nature, teach them tree ecology and inspire them to adopt a more environmental sustainable life

-encourage the simple act of picking fruit which will remind/teach people the value of trees and green spaces encouraging them to become better stewards of our urban environment.

-increase social inclusion/ increasing participant health by engaging with others and connecting with neighbours through hands on effective community action.

-increase public awareness that our local food banks accept healthy fruit and veg through locally established programs.
